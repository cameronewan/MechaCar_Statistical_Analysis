## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- vehicle length & ground_clearance
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- We should consider the slope of the linear model to be zero because as the MPG increases so deos all the other variables, which would result in a slope of 0.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- Yes the model is an accurate predictor for MPG of the MechaCar because over 71% of the data has a confrimed relationship, meaning it's not random chance.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
- According to our data the current data does not meet the design specification because the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch, but lot 3 is larger than 100PSI.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
- The results of our T-test tell us that there was no significant difference from the population mean of 1500.
